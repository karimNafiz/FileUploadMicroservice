upload session 
in the upload session package we have two important go-routine working
one go routine is listening for incoming data on the connection
the other go routine is handling all the channel for that go routine
but nothing ties them together
if one go routines fails or stop for reasons not taken through code
we will have a go-routine leak
first introduce timeouts
secondly use a context to connect both the go-routines
this doesn't have to be care of right now
get the file upload service working first with foreign service
in version take care of this aspect

todo 2
upload session service status consider the benefits of having a struct representing the message being sent back to the clients

todo 3
in the service package, handle proper clean up when the context is Done
